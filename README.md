# My first webscapper


I have always been interested in knowing how webscrapping actually wokrs, so I build this simple scrapper using beautifull soup.

It was a fun experience ,im proud of the code itself, even tho there are still some improvements needed to be made specially in  functions, 
since my mother tongue is C++ , i'm still getting used to programming in a true pythonic way with list comprenhensions ( even tho I did a little 
bit of it in this project).

Overall  I did this project  to improve my coding skills, and at the same time learn how to parse through HTML.


## How it work 


I think the code itself is pretty readable, there are some confusing functions namely get_info   and get_price, but they literally just grab the 
text you want from the HTML soup file.

This project is pretty much adatable to any website with page=n format, with some little changes in the code ! I'd love suggestions and feedback, 
so feel free to hit me up via likedin through my mail pedrogodinhoc@gmail.com 

Have fun scrapping
